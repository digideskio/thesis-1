In the last decade a variety of dynamic programing languages have became
largely popular in web and systems fields due to the lack of type declarations
and their flexible semantics to make programs concise, attributes that result
very appealing for many programers. However some programmers have noticed that
many programs developed using dynamic languages are difficult to maintain over
the long run due to the lack of static type checking.

Dynamic programming languages often trade the convenience and flexibility which
characterize them for safety abandoning the advantages of static type checking.
Statically typed languages prioritize the early detection of errors eliminating
many common user errors at compile-time and providing a better framework for
structure of large applications. In languages without static type checking many
errors are detected during runtime or remain unnoticed during a long time.

A recent trend in some programming languages is reconciliate the advantages of
both kinds of languages adding optional static type systems to dynamic
languages, while preserving the styles and conventions distinctive of this kind
of languages. When using optional static type systems the programmers can begin
development with dynamic types, and migrate to static types as the program
matures.

This thesis describes the designing and implementing an optional static
type system for Elixir, a dynamic programming language that runs under
Erlang VM, using ideas and lessons learnt from other projects like Clojure's
core.typed, Typed Racket and previous attempts to add static type checkening
to Erlang, the de-facto programming language for Erlang VM.

Multiple existing Elixir projects are used to demostrate that proposed
static typed checker can be used for type checking of sufficiently complicated
code and fits naturally with the existing languages constructs and style.

In essence, this thesis work leads to the conclusion that is possible to implement
an optional static type system for Elixir programming language and that this type
system is sufficiently practical for use in real-world Elixir projects.
